I have not used Celery as celery has been discontinued for windows. Using wsl to use celery would have been possible but due to time constraints, I could not do it.
I tried oher possible solutions I found on the web but none of them worked.
I have not used any tables, as I would have used them if their was a job id after using celery.
So, in the form where the tables are to be uploaded, I will be uploading the output file as it is a required field in the form.
